Solve the Problem on the logical level first.

=========================
Understanding the Problem
=========================

Goal: understand what you're being asked to do.

Establish the rules & boundaries of the problem?
What are the implicit and explicit requirements?
Ask clarifying questions.
Make note of any questions you hope to answer by examining the test cases in the next step.

rules:
- the output needs to be sorted in x order
- input will always be positive number

=======================
Examples and test cases
=======================

Goal: understand more about what you're being asked to do.

We should use our examination of the test cases to confirm or refute our assumptions of the problem.
A good way to see the rules/boundaries in actions.
If the return value is an array-- take a look at the order of elements.
If problem involves strings-- should we treat strings in a case-insensitive manner?
What about empty arguments?
Walk through all test cases with your understanding of the problem and see if they confirm your understanding.
May need/want to write some of your own test cases.

================
Data structures
================

Goal: begin to think logically and solution-based about the problem.

How we structure our data is closely related to our algorithm and the steps we may take to solve the problem.
Helps us to reason with our data more logically.
What does our data look like when we get it? (input)
What does our data look like when we return it? (output)
What does our data need to look like in between (intermediary steps)?

================
Algorithm
================

Goal: write out high-level steps to solve the given problem.

A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective.
Be abstract and high-level (don't box yourself in to a specific implementation, for example).
Language-agnostic.  Your algorithm should be applicable no matter what language someone is using to code a solution.
Find a solution that works (don't worry about efficiency for now)
Can create substeps for different parts
Separate concerns can potentially be moved into a helper function.
You can (and should) return to your algorithm during the implementation stage to update.
Although you want to keep your algorithm high-level in that you don't want your algorithm to be code-specific, you should take care not to skip over necessary steps in the problem solving process.  For example, if a step in your algorithm is 'determine if number is prime'.  There should be sub-steps there walking through how you would determine if the number is prime.
