### Practice 6 ###

***One of the most frequently used real-world string operations is that of "string substitution," where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.***

***Given this previously seen family object, print the name, age, and gender of each family member:***

```
let munsters = {
  herman: { age: 32, gender: 'male' },
  lily: { age: 30, gender: 'female' },
  grandpa: { age: 402, gender: 'male' },
  eddie: { age: 10, gender: 'male' },
  marilyn: { age: 23, gender: 'female'}
};
```
***Each output line should follow this pattern:***
```
(Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).
```

for (person in munsters) {
  console.log(`${person} is a ${munsters[person].age}-year-old ${munsters[person].gender}.`);
}

***LS Answer:***

```
Object.entries(munsters).forEach(entry => {
  let name = entry[0];
  let age = entry[1]['age'];
  let gender = entry[1].gender;

  console.log(`${name} is a ${age}-year-old ${gender}.`);
});
```

*Here, we need to access both the key (each family member's name) and the value (the inner objects containing the details), so we need to use Object.entries, which gives us each key-value pair as the first and second elements of a sub-array.*
